This repository contains an extremely simple seed repository for generative music experiments, to be made in the Fullstack2gether workshop.

There are three files in the application:

* `index.html` - the HTML host page.
* `app.js` - for all the JavaScript code.
* `style.css` - for CSS should we need any.

Of course, you may add other files if you want to.

Additionally, the `index.html` page loads up [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) from a CDN.

You can run the app using any HTTP server, but for convenience a `lite-server` dev dependency has been added, so you can spin up a dev server with the following commands:

```
yarn install      # Or "npm install"
yarn run  start   # or "npm run start"
```
